  "description": "\nPlayers use the Eyetoy USB Camera to interact with the onscreen graphics in 101 mini games with a sports theme. As the title implies these mini games are sports themes and cover a wide range of activities, from Olympic sports like sprinting and swimming through to car racing and trampolining. Most games require four players but there are plenty that can be played with only two.\n",
