  "description": "\nIn Mountainboard Stunt Racing the player participates in illegal skateboard races. The nine courses are basically sloping mountains with many obstacles and ramps on the way. The player gains speed and respect points by making successful stunts. Various bonus items on the way help the player, e.g. weapons to shoot the up to seven opponents. The player creates his own character and dress him with unlockable clothes. There are several playing modes like races, freestyle or slalom.\n",
