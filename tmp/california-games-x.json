  "description": "\nCalifornia Games X is a mobile game based on Epyx' series of extreme sports games. The game consists of seven events that can be played on their own or as part of a tournament mode. The tournament mode involves competing against AI opponents and can be played in three different difficulties. There is also a practice mode for training. The available events are:\nSurfing\nFree Climbing\nBMX\nBreakdancing\nSkysurfing\nSkateboarding\nIn-Line Skating (has to be unlocked)\nAll game events are built around quick time events where a key or combination of keys on the numpad has to be pressed when the corresponding arrows appear or are highlighted on the screen. The gameplay thereby is similar to a rhythm game except with no music.\n",
