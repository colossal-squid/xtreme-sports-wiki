  "description": "\nShaun White Skateboarding is a sports game, similar to Tony Hawk games. Shaun White is guest star, but he isn't main playable character.\n\nThe game takes place in the grey city of New Harmony, controlled by the Ministry, with characteristics similar to Orwell's \"1984\". Only the player, who can make tricks on skateboards can change this city. The game has many moves that can be performed. It also has some elements of \"magic\" - the player can create special structures with his mind. Beside this, Shaun White Skateboarding is \"normal\", skateboarding game - the player makes use of city structures to do tricks on dizzying heights, alleys, half-pipes, bowls, and extended rails for long grinds...\n\nThe game world is quasi-open - the player can freely ride on skateboards (or walk on legs) in areas, but new districts must be unlocked first. When performing tricks in areas the people will become inspired and the environments will become more colourful.\n\nThe game supports multiplayer.\n",
