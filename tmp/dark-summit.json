  "description": "\nThe military has mysteriously closed the summit of Mt. Garrick, and Chief O'Leary is trying desperately to drive snowboarders off the mountain.\n\nDark Summit is a twist on the snowboarding genre. Instead of trying to pull off insane tricks, you'll be completing various missions, such as \"Find the Bomb\" and \"Destroy the Cannon\". Pulling off tricks earns you points to buy new equipment.\n",
