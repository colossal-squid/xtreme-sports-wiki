  "description": "\nCompete for the gold in 8 different winter themed sports in this handheld sports offering by Konami. The game is similar to Konami's earlier sports games in the Track & Field legacy, where a mix of button-mashing and accurate timing will win the player the medals.\n\nThe player can either compete in the Championship Mode where all 8 sports are played in a row, or there's the option to play them all individually. There are several different skiing events, bob, speed skating and half-pipe snowboarding for the player to master.\n",
