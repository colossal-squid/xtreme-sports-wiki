  "description": "\nSkydive: Proximity Flight is a semi-realistic skydiving simulator with wingsuits. They do not only cover the entire body, but the material also extends to the space between the legs and between the arms and torso. This results in inhibition rate of descent and allows player to something that resembles a flight. During the game players get the opportunity to try out many different suits and jump from mountains in Switzerland, the Grand Canyon, Hạ Long Bay, and Italy. While descending it is possible to perform tricks, use a speed-boosting shot of adrenaline and open the parachute to end the run. The closer to the ground the parachute is finally opened, the more points are awarded. The game also contains a weather system that affects the conditions of descent. The game can be played in single-player or with friends in a multiplayer mode. There are races against AI opponents, but also a freestyle mode where the environments can be freely explored.\n",
