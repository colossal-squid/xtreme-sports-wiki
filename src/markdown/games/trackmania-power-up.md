TrackMania: Power Up! combines the original TrackMania with the Power Up! expansion. Owners of the original version can download the add-on for free, but Digital Jesters decided to re-release it in one package.

Power Up! adds a new solo mode, visible opponents during solo races, an extended view-line, enhanced multiplayer modes, a video editing replay centre, improved multiplayer code, new interfaces, in-game videos, new construction blocks, bug fixes and tweaks.
