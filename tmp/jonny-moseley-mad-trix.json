  "description": "\nJonny Moseley Mad Trix is an extreme skiing game, in the vein of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.\n\nAs Jonny Moseley, or a number of other real-life skiers, you must perform various stunts, of which there are hundreds, to attract the attention of movie studio's, ultimately to film you on runs.\n\nThere are two modes of play; Slopestyle, where you can go down hills and perform stunts without any mission goals or other distractions, and Big Mountain, where you perform tricks to star in a ski movie.\n\nBy performing good tricks, you will be able to see your run on the \"big screen\".\n\nIn Big Mountain mode, you will ski down several real-life mountains, including Everest, Kilimanjaro, and the Alaskan mountains. In Slopestyle, head down fictional environments, like a snowed-in San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Las Vegas.\n",
