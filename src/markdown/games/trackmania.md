###Description: 
TrackMania is a racing game where the player has to build his track before racing on it. The game is a mix of track building, puzzles and driving. The player has over 300 different blocks to choose from when building his tracks, from straight blocks to adjustable corners and loops. Each track can consist of 2000 blocks. When playing for the first time the player will only have access to a few blocks from the catalogue, enough to complete the first challenges in the game. For every new medal or best time achieved the player will get more coppers that are used to buy new blocks. The game offers three environments (desert, countryside and snow) that require different driving techniques.
