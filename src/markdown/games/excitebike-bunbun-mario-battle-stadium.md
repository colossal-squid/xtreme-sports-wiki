###Description: 
As the title suggests, this game is a crossover between the Mario and Excitebike series. The game was exclusively released as a broadcast on the Satellaview add-on for the Super Famicom. The game was split into four episodes. Depending on which episode is being played, the roster of playable characters changes. In the first episode, Mario, Luigi, and Toad are available. In the second episode, Wario is added, and in the third, Princess Peach. In the fourth episode, Yoshi is made available, but Luigi is subtracted from the roster.

Like the original Excitebike, players must safely maneuver through a dangerous course on motorbikes. Obstacles appear that can slow the player down or send them flying. In the event they do become airborne, players must adjust the angle of their bike as they fall to prevent crashing. Players can also race by themselves against computer-controlled Green and Red Koopa Troopas, or against each other in a 2-player 1-on-1 race.
