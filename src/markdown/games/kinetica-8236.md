###Description:
They're called kinetic suits. They represent a total merging of man and machine with one goal in mind: speed. High speed. The "drivers" do more than operate their cycles -- they become cycles for insane velocity and maneuverability in this ultimate futuristic race. Besides acceleration and braking, the kinetic suits allow various antigravity tricks that can be performed for speed boosts, not unlike the system seen in SSX. At breakneck speed, there's no room for error; quick decisions and lightning reflexes are needed to weave your way through the tight tracks. Strap yourself in for one of the fastest rides you'll ever experience with your PS2!
