  "description": "\nA surfing game in the vein of Tony Hawk where you perform tricks to rack up points. With great looking waves and top-notch sound, it can have a somewhat calming effect. You get to pick from different 13 real-life surfers and 9 different locations such as Pipeline, Hawaii and Teahupoo, Tahiti. Also includes a \"Karma\" system where if you act like a jerk (stealing other surfers waves, hitting people, etc.) bad things will happen. Bad things with dorsal fins.\n",
