###Description: 
Inline race brings inline skating to your pc. Pick one out of the eight skaters, each with their unique style and discover five locations: the city, the metro, a factory, the parking lot and a race course. You can perform stunts, such as Grap, Royal Shifty, Soul Grind and other on your own, or you can race friends in the multiplayer mode. Each track has a fitting music score as well.
