###Description: 
Another SEGA AGES release which features reworked versions of 3 classic SEGA titles, Decathlete, Winter Heat and Virtua Athlete 2K all sharing similar gameplay mechanics which reward coordinated button mashing as seen on similar sport titles.

The graphics for all the games have been significantly upgraded and given the abundance of events and characters to choose from, the collection features 4-player competitive gameplay in which you can mix any character with any event, as well as three different gameplay modes: Free, Exhibition and Edit mode, in which you can set up your own series of events and challenges.
