Players can ride around the massive open-world of Sialia, a perfectly crafted playground to explore and compete in. The mountain features epic lines, massive cliffs and carefully designed terrain parks. Players can freely discover this vast and varied terrain or attempt to prove themselves by setting high 
scores on SNOW’s leaderboards.
