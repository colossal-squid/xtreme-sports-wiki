###Description:
The game uses a motion-sensing peripheral called the "Motion Pack", which is inserted into the Game Boy Advance game slot as the method of control. As well as skateboarding, the game also offers snowboarding.

Hue Pixel Painter is a little known puzzle/platforming hybrid where the game was controlled by moton controls. Hue Pixel Painter was the other game in a two-pack of games commonly refered to as just Tony Hawk's Motion for the Nintendo DS.
