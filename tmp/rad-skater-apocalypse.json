  "description": "\nRad Skater Apocalypse is a retro-inspired indie-punk game set on the streets of Fitzroy, Melbourne, Australia. You play as a hipster scooting along the street on your skateboard just at the moment that 8-bit invaders start breaking through into our reality, to take revenge for the beating they got in the arcades of the '80s.\n\nIt is an endless skating game where the character collects mix tapes and avoiding and dispatches a variety of arcade-inspired enemies such as flashing space invaders, alley cat dogs, pixelated zombies, and strange Dalek-like mini-bosses. More enemies and powers are unlocked by achieving high scores.\n\nIt is a commercial game unlike the later-released free-to-play version Rad Skater Apocalypse Boom!\n",
