Motorstorm: Arctic Edge is an arcade racer pitting you against 8 other racers, human or AI in a competition to win in The Festival. The backdrop for the game is Alaska where you have to race on icy tracks in mountainous regions. Beside the other racers you have to take into account avalanches, broken ice bridges and a lot of other dangers on the route to victory. 
 
The game is very fast-paced and it sees you racing around in cars, snowmobiles and trucks. You can select different wheels, exhausts, spoilers and more for your vehicles.
