###Description:
0.5 MPH is extremely fast-when your vehicle is only big enough to carry an ant! Jockey for first place with your favorite character from the hit motion picture Antzâ„¢, using vehicles that aren't your typical garden variety. 
 Surf using a leaf, race on a fuse with wheels, even hop on a wasp for the antenna-raising thrill ride of your life! You may feel tiny, but practice will make you a giant among racers!
