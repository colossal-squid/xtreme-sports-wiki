  "description": "\nThe second installment of the Big Beach Sports series is presenting 8 outdoor activities, as there are Canoe, Cricket, Disc Golf, Dune Buggy, Water Rocket, Rugby, Soccer, and Surfing. Whilst only the latter one makes use of it the support of the Wii Balance Board is still completely new to this series. Just similar to it's predecessor players are invited to a single player mode or to accept the challenge to play against up to three friends during a multiplayer session.\n",
