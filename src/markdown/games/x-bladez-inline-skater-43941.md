###Description:
In-line skating comes to the flourishing category of "extreme sports" video gaming in X-Bladez. Players choose one of six characters to flip, spin, and grind through slalom and circuit courses in an assortment of 3D environments. Race for speed or hot dog for style. Time-of-day and weather effects add variety to the look and mood of the virtual skate parks. 
 
Unlock new environments as you progress and upgrade your skates with the money you earn.
