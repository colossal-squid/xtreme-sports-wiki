###Description:
In the year 2097, BMX riding has been outlawed and a twisted reality game show is the showcase for public execution of these fugitives. The maniacal host of the show, Dixon Von Blass, has eliminated all but a handful of these riders and resorted to injecting his contestants with a powerful toxin before the show. Injected with the deadly toxin, you were chosen to compete through famous locations and time periods. The only way to survive is to complete objectives, avoid deadly obstacles, and pull off insane tricks--all the while avoiding Dixon's henchmen.
