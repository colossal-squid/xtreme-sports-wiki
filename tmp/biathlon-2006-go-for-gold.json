  "description": "\nBiathlon 2006: Go for Gold is the fifth part in the Biathlon series. Like its predecessors it allows you to play the Biathlon on your PC.\n\nBiathlon consists of two elements: cross-country skiing and rifle shooting on a shooting range. The game features a unique mixture of racing and shooting. If you waste too much energy during the race, the shooting parts will become more difficult. Game modes include arcade, career, time attack and hot seat. Disciplines include sprint, hunting, relay and mass start. There are ten different tracks to race on. Players can create their own avatar and fine tune the various stats such as stamina, heart rate and concentration.\n",
