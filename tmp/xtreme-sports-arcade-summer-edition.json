  "description": "\nIn this game you can play one of five \"xtreme\" sports: half-pipe skateboarding, sky boarding, in-line street skating, rock climbing, and street luge. Each sport has a different character to play as. There are ways to earn points, like doing tricks and passing through goals, as well as power-ups and obstacles, from oil slicks and traffic cones to snakes and scorpions. This game led to the more popular game Xtreme Sports for Game Boy Color.\n",
