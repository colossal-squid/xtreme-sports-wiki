###Description: 
TrackMania Original is a re-release of the original TrackMania, along with the Power Up! expansion (released for free), enhancements from the Speed Up! patches (never released) and improvements from the free Original add-on. Owners of the original game can upgrade to this version without an additional purchase, but all enhancements have been included with the full game in this budget-priced bundle.

Aside from new features such as ad-pannels, mediatracker effects, AI opponents, multiplayer options and new game modes, the entire game has been ported to the Sunrise engine, delivering a steep boost in graphical quality.
