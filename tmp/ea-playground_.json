  "description": "\nEA Playground on the Nintendo DS features classic playground games. It is similar to the Wii version, but has different activities and different gameplay. The games are Dodgeball, Hoops, Hopscotch, RC Car Racing, Bug Hunt, Kicks, Skate & Sketch (where you connect the dots while skateboarding), Spitball and Trampoline. By winning games the player can collect stickers and marbles, being able to trade them in for power-ups to use in the games.\n\nThe gameplay consists of using the stylus pin and the d-pad on the DS, players can even blow into the mic to launch spitballs at opponents. Players can go head-to-head with each other using Wi-Fi.\n",
