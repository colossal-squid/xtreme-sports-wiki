With 11 playable characters, your goal is to take to the surfboard and ride up and down the crests of the ocean in your choice of 6 different areas. Take your skill to performing 11 separate tricks which can be linked together without limits. And all this done to the tunes of a mighty punk rock soundtrack!\n",
