Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2 is the newest game scheduled for release on Game Boy Advance under Activision's O2 brand. Based on the series that originally started on PlayStation years ago, the game lets players travel with Mat Hoffman, Mike Escamilla, Chad Kagy, Cory Nastazio, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Kevin Robinson, and Simon Tabron across eight cities in the United States. Expanding the extreme sports genre, Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2 features a 'Trick Morpher' that lets players use any combination of tricks, specially customized courses, a photo book for all those great replay moments and both single and multiplayer modes.
