###Description: 
Monster Jam: Path of Destruction is mostly a series of monster-truck-based mini-games, with the option to customize the player's truck. The challenges include; trick missions (learn new tricks), stadium and circuit races (full-length and small-segment races respectively), points missions (do the most tricks for the most points), and time trials. Each mission can be done on either Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty. The level of difficulty determines how much experience the player gains, and each level-up provides more parts for customization, and more levels to play in.
