###Platforms

###Description:
Rip the ultimate line on wide-open, real mountains packed with challenges. Whether you hit the cliffs, grind fallen trees, jib the rainbow tree rail, or take the hidden paths, you decide where and how you go down. While you pull off insane tricks on rails, kickers, and half pipes, remember to pose for roaming photographers and camera crews. With enough exposure, you'll find your face on magazine covers and videos and even become an international media superstar.
