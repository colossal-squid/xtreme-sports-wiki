###Platforms
Game Boy Advance

###Description: 
You play a stuntman who has the task of completing some difficult and challenging stunts for a film director. Get it right and he'll ask you on for another project, and pay you big time. Get it wrong, and it's time for a career change.

Apart from the Movie Making mode, Precision Tests will have you completing courses of varying difficulty, where you'll have to drive forward and reverse, launch off of jumps, dodge through posts and then park inside a zone before time runs out. In Jump Tests, you'll be out to grab letters while jumping off of platforms to catch them while airborne.

You can also play against a friend in the various multiplayer modes to see who has the best control over their car.
