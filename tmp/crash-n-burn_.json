  "description": "\nCrash ‘n Burn is a racing game with vehicle-mounted guns and rockets. There is both a Rally mode and a Tournament mode to compete in. In the Rally Mode you race your way through up to 30 tracks with the goal of staying alive and destroying the other contenders while you try and finish in the top three. If you succeed then you advance to the next track.\n\nIn Tournament Mode you drive the same tracks in a sudden death race for dominance. Along the way you can win prize money by placing in the top three. You can then use that money to add guns, energy weapons, missiles, hazards, armor and other special enhancements.\n\nYou can choose from among six vehicle/driver combinations that are weighted towards fire power, speed or balance. Unlimited pit stops are available to repair damage and reload your weapons.\n",
