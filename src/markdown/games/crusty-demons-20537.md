###Description:
The Crusty Demons are a gang of bikers who tour the world performing outrageous bike stunts and participating in all manner of crazy skits with motorized vehicles. In a pact with the Devil, they are offered immortality - the ability to crash time and time again, yet still live to walk away - at the cost of signing over their souls.
