  "description": "\nThis action shoot ‘em up has an unusual setting, pitching you as a movie stuntman trying to complete the toughest scenes of the latest blockbuster.\n\nThe scenes include desert chases, forest rallying and Grand Canyon jumps. There are 7 levels in total, each teeming with ‘bad guys’ and scenery obstacles. You score points for each enemy you shoot down.\n\nUnusually, you get bonuses for crashing anything up to twice (as this can be perceived to maximize the action stakes for the film), but a third crash means Game Over.\n",
