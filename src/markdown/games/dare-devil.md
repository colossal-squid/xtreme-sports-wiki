###Description: 
In Dare-Devil you assume the role of a stunt performer with a gift for motorcycle jumping. Our dashing adrenaline junkie takes on a formidable challenge: a series of jumps over an increasing number of buses. On your way to the launch ramp, you pick up speed and finetune it by adjusting your throttle. If you clear the jump without crashing, you get to repeat your accomplishment with one more bus added.

To win, you have to successfully make the final jump over nine buses. Lives are unlimited, so having your body scraped off the floor is merely a minor hitch on the way to victory.
