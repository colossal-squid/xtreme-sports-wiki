###Description:
Surfing H3O is the first game to bring the danger and excitement of professional big wave surfing to the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system. Set in beautiful locales, you must master hardcore surfing techniques to handle the most epic waves. Features include 11 playable characters each with specific characteristics, six unique surfing environments, over a dozen aerial tricks that can be linked for unlimited combinations, and an authentic punk rock-powered surf soundtrack courtesy of Hopeless Records. As an extra bonus, early versions of Surfing H30 shipped with a special patented X-Board controller attachment that latched onto the analog sticks of the Dual Shock to simulate the surfing experience.
