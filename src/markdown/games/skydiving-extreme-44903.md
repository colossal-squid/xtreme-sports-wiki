###Description:
This Natsume entry into the realm of extreme sports gaming puts the player in charge of a squad of highly-trained synchronized skydivers. As in reality, there is a short period between the time the diver leaves the plane and has to open his chute and the game's challenge comes in aligning the free-falling team members to form impressive formations before the time limit expires. 
 
Players can lead their team in competition against a string of computer-controlled international contenders, or go head-to-head against a friend. Each squad can perform over 40 different formations and a practice mode allows the player to perfect his skills without the time limit.
