All new fighting allows you to punch your opponent while racing. Lifelike boarders carve through courses textured to perfection illustrating amazing detail to rocks, bumps, ice, jumps, canyons and cliffs. The most breathtaking mountain views this side of the Rockies! Choose from 16 Burton and 6 Ride snowboards all individually designed with their own specific performance and board graphics. Battle for the win while racing against opponents in the Downhill, Boardercross, and Slalom events or go for huge air in the Half Pipe, Big Air and Slope Style events.
