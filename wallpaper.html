Avalanche is a sequel to 1080° Snowboarding for the Nintendo 64. The game has an emphasis on racing, rather than doing tricks, in contrast to other popular snowboarding games, such as the SSX series. It can output in 480p and Dolby Pro Logic II and supports four players on one GameCube as well as LAN play with up to four GameCubes.",

Twisting and turning, you thread the needle between two billboards, earning cheers from your fans.   But while reflexes are important, it's quick thinking that gets you the win. One block away, you spot a crowd of protesters decrying your sport, and make a split second decision. You break off course, stare them straight in the eye, and flip them the finger.

Progress through the career mode, where you must complete objectives (such as grind a certain object(s) to jump over large gaps and gain points) to open up further arenas, which there are 7 in all, and once your bored with them, you can make your own in the park editor. The game doesn't use a hard time limit but the so-called \"juice meter\": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a \"learning by doing\" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level which open up new areas within the level.",

He goes down the mountain automatically and the player only interacts by tapping. This is done to jump over rocks, cross gaps, grind on lines and so on.By tapping and holding while in the air a backflip is performed. When completed successfully a speed boost is earned and this is sometimes required to cross certain gaps. Grinding also provides this boost and in addition the boost makes his scarf longer and provides a temporary shield that can for instance be used to dash through rocks. Along the way coins can be collected as well as llamas, adding up to the same total. Tricks can be combined into combos. After crashing, a run ends right away, unless these coins are spent or the player watches a video advertisement. Apart from that there are no other advertisements and no in-app purchases at all.Each run has a procedurally generated environment based around different themes and times of day. Goals can be completed permanently to move on to new challenges, such as jumping, bouncing or smashing rocks, spooking birds, jumping ramp kickers and so on. Sometimes power-ups can be found such as a coin magnet, a hover feather, a wingsuit and a llama horn. The coins can be used in the workshop to upgrade the effectiveness of these power-ups several times. Next to the main challenge mode there is a zen mode with no score or distractions. A photo mode can be activated to take and share pictures.###Screenshots<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/847707-alto-s-adventure-android-screenshot-a-big-jump.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/847707-alto-s-adventure-android-screenshot-a-big-jump.jpg\"/></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/847713-alto-s-adventure-android-screenshot-total-stats.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/847713-alto-s-adventure-android-screenshot-total-stats.jpg\"/></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/847701-alto-s-adventure-android-screenshot-boosting-through-a-forest.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/847701-alto-s-adventure-android-screenshot-boosting-through-a-forest.jpg\"/></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/847704-alto-s-adventure-android-screenshot-i-missed-the-jump.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/847704-alto-s-adventure-android-screenshot-i-missed-the-jump.jpg\"/></a>"

        "description": "Asphalt: Nitro is a spin-off of the Asphalt racing series like the previous game Asphalt: Overdrive. Players race in single-player and multiplayer games with different types of game modes and locations such as Brazil, China, Iceland, the Alps and the USA. Much like Overdrive it takes an arcade approach with an emphasis on the use of boosts, drifting, jumps with mid-air tricks and takedowns (knockdowns) on other cars. Races often have a small amount of traffic, forking paths, shortcuts and sometimes a vertical design with multiple levels of driving road stacked on top of each other, accessed through jumps. Cars are divided into five tiers and are licensed from manufacturers with the brands and designs of cars such as a Bugatti, Chrysler, Dodge, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Lotus, McLaren, Mitsubishi etc.The single-player career mode consists of six seasons where up to five stars can be earned based on the results. Stars are needed to keep unlocking new events and eventually the next season. Optionally all seasons can be unlocked right away through an in-app purchase. Race types are Classic (race for first place), Versus (compete against one other racer), Elimination (the last racer is eliminated after a certain time), Gate Drift (drift through gates beating a target score with a time limit), Knockdown (the racer with the most knockdowns with a time limit wins), Infected (the last racer receives an infection and can infect other cars; after some time the infection wears off, but wrecks the car; infected races can infect others by bumping into them; infected racers have unlimited nitro and can gain additional time for the infection to wear off by taking out opponents or collecting nitro power-ups), Escape (time based checkpoint race), and Catch (drive a cop car and eliminate opponents by taking them out or using an EMP; opponents can drop mines). For single-player there are also quick races with no rewards. Online multiplayer is available for the racing types Classic, Elimination and Infected. There are also time-limited multiplayer events for special rewards. These require fuel as a currency to enter and it is refilled slowly over time. Only this part of the game has an energy/stamina system. Multiplayer has matchmaking based on a global ranking that is changed with each race.The game supports four types of control schemes: three based on auto-acceleration (tilt to steer, tap to steer, on-screen controls) and one based on manual acceleration with icons and tilting the device. Reckless and aggressive driving and performing stunts is encouraged to earn rewards. In addition to collecting icons while racing it is also the most important way to acquire nitro, shown in a horizontal meter near the top of the screen. Nitro boost is activated through a tap and it can be hit up to three times with different power levels, but draining faster. There is also a perfect nitro system based on timing a red section in the nitro bar. When approaching a sharp turn, drifting is activated through a tap on the left side of the screen and tapping again ends the drift. Tricks such as a flat spin are performed by entering drift before jumping.Next to stars to unlock new races and increase the inventory, credits are the most important currency to buy new cars and upgrades. They are provided based on the performances in races with many types of goals. Next to painting a car it can be upgraded four parameters: Acceleration, Handling, Nitro and Top Speed, with seven upgrade levels for each parameter. Credits can also be used to buy kit boxes. They contain common, rare or legendary cards for three main areas (Engines, Parts and Tools) with several sub types. Kit boxes also contain boosters and fuel. Complete sets of cards are used to access upgrades and they can be exchanged with other players. Asphalt tokens are the premium currency to unlock content right away such as premium items, the full racing season, exclusive cars, kit boxes, bundles, additional fuel, boosters, more card inventory slots etc. Boosters that can be bought and are activated prior to a race are double credits, nitro starter, tuning kit (one additional level for each of the four parameters) and extra tank (more nitro capacity). When players buy items with real money they earn VIP points that provide access to up to six VIP levels. VIP levels provides free kits, a reduction of the refresh time for kits, additional fuel cells and a quicker refill, more basic credits, additional upgrade levels and more inventory slots.The game was initially released as a commercial title and only available directly from Gameloft. The later Google Play release is an updated version of the game, turned into a free-to-play title with an emphasis on in-app purchases and the introduction of the VIP system, more types of cars (21 instead of 10) and Pro Kits with cards as a new type of upgrade system.",

Unlike the previous three titles in the series, this game strays from just simply ATV's in it's roster of vehicles. Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs from it's predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.",

While primarily a BMX-based action sports title, it earned most of its notoriety for containing nudity, foul language and adult humor. The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless and view live-action video clips of real life strippers, also with bare breasts. Consequently, BMX XXX was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version. While the adult content garnered a great deal of publicity for the game, it was almost entirely negative, and it was eventually released to dismal reviews and poor sales.",

        "description": "ursTrick: Wake Boarding!! is an extreme-sports game using gameplay similar to Wave Race 64, the main difference being that, as you are pulled by a boat when wake boarding, it is almost like an auto-scroller and you do not have nearly as much freedom of movement.  There are two gameplay modes, Obstacle and Trick. In Obstacle mode, you race around a track and must complete the track in time and collect enough points by wake boarding through rings and over jumps. In Trick mode, you compete to score as many points as possible by performing tricks. There are over 45 tricks in total.",

Rather than the typical heavy emphasis on hunting, firearms, and dangerous animal species, Adventure Camp focuses on the more \"outdoorsy sportsman\" and camping aspects of the Cabela's brand. Here, the only hunting is with a bow and arrow, and the targets are merely cardboard shapes of animals like deer--when the targets aren't simple round concentric circles.There are six playable characters, all children or young teens who are \"attending\" a Cabela's-themed camp. Hair and clothing colors can be changed, and stats are recorded. Another child, known as Greg, exists to grief the player during some points in certain events, which includes things like dropping boulders into the river during a kayaking event. Greg takes no active role in the gameplay, rather, unusual challenges or obstacles are \"blamed\" on the character.Events in the game include kayaking, skeet shooting, archery, bicycling, and others. Two somewhat more \"unusual\" games also exist, one of which is a form of Whack-a-Mole combined with the memorization of the classic electronic game Simon. The other is a variation on Rock-Paper-Scissors called \"Bear-Hunter-Ninja\" and requires the players to stand in predefined stances to pose as a Bear, a Hunter, or a Ninja. Aside from the Whack-a-Mole and Bear-Hunter-Ninja games, all the other games have at least two variations, typically a different course or set of challenges, and can be played by two to four players. Coins/Emblems can be collected in many events, along with large gems for extra points.",

        "description": "ig Air Wakeboarding is probably the first wakeboarding game for PC :) But WTF is wakeboarding? :)  Well, wakeboarding is the watersport of the 1990's, and the fastest-growing board sport world-wide. Akin to snowboarding, the sports popularity is spreading like wildfire around the globe. Evolving from a combination of waterskiing, snowboarding, skating and surfing, wakeboarding is not only the world's fastest-growing water board sport but also the most accessible. It can be done on waterski lakes or on the sea. Riders are able to perform amazing BIG AIR tricks (Backwash, Bindings, Edge, Fakie etc), whilst being towed behind a boat, with the use of big boards and big wakes. The rider stands sideways on a shorter, wider board similar in concept to a snowboard. If you have no imagination, look at these shots from real wakeboarding (shot1, shot2, shot3). So now I think you have an idea kind of sport wakeboarding is, so back to the game.Big Air Wakeboarding features over eight distinct characters, hundreds of different mind-bending trick combos, multiple jumps and obstacles, real wakeboards from O'Brien, and Darin Shapiro - the 2000 X Games and Pro Wakeboard Tour Champion. In the game you can choose from Career, Competition and Quick Start. In Career mode you have to collect Gas cans, to improve your character over time.These Gas cans unlock new board graphics and improve on the quality of all boards. Gas can also unlock better boats with bigger wakes and more advanced tie-ins. In Competition you got three runs out in the open water to try and rack up the most points - any medal in a competition will unlock the next course. If you like skateboarding and snowboarding games, maybe this game could be quite interesting for you",

        "description": "volution Skateboarding is a 2002 skateboarding video game released by Konami for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube. It consists of several popular skateboarders, such as Rick McCrank, Arto Saari, Kerry Getz, and Danny Way. There is also a create-a-skater feature and an unlockable character for every skater the player completes the game as. There are also sets of level specific songs such as the metal-remix of the Metal Gear Solid theme and a Castlevania theme after unlocking the Vampire Hunter. Levels are unlocked by beating a certain amount of objectives in a current level, such as collecting items like boots and other objects, performing tricks in certain areas of a level, and the occasional grinding a certain amount of meters. The Evolution Skateboarding engine was used in the bonus skateboarding mode included in the PlayStation 2 version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance.",

        "description": "A launch game for the Nintendo Wii, Excite Truck is the \"sequel\" to the Excitebike games for the NES and N64. The term sequel is used lightly, because now instead of playing on motorcycles, you are racing monstrous trucks across constantly transforming outdoors terrains.Like its predecessors, Excite Truck is a racing game pitting you against multiple opponents or other players. Players have the ability to play in tournaments against NPC's to unlock medals, play head to head, or play a single-player special mode. Single player features a mode that allows players to go up against computer-controlled trucks in a competition with two branching difficulties across 4 medal challenges (bronze, silver, medal, platinum). The multiplayer head-to-head also allows for two players to race their trucks against each other, but without the use of the other NPC trucks. Special modes include a slalom challenge, a leap-through-rings jumping challenge, and a demolition derby. Players race on outdoor tracks in a number of locales from Fiji to Scotland. The map is littered with obstacles such as jumps, water hazards, and cliffs to impede your progress.Instead of using a traditional joystick, the game is specifically designed around the Wii remote's motion sensing ability. The controller is held sideways without the nunchuk attached, like a steering wheel. Players tilt the controller left and right to turn their truck. In the air, players can tilt the remote back and forth to lean their truck forward or backwards. The #2 button is used for gas, and the D-pad can be used for a turbo.The term \"Excite\" is not just used to make the game look like the sequel to an old NES classic. Excite Truck features a complete loss of realism, emphasis on turbo, and chaotic game play. Players have the ability to push their truck's speed far past physical limitations, and jumps can be used to achieve jump heights akin to the N64 game San Francisco Rush. Simply by picking up icons, players or even NPC's can reform the land to make shortcuts and ramps. The game encourages the players' use of turbo, and even emphasizes chaotic driving through its overuse. Some stunts may even be rewarded by more boost or a power-up.Pulling off these maneuvers is not just a feature, but a core mechanic that is used to progress through the game. Like the Burnout series, performing death-defying stunts not only benefits the player, but rewards them with \"star points\". These points are what actually unlocks new modes and races. While coming in first place is important to earn more star points, it may not be necessary if the player drives crazy enough during the race.Using an SD card, the game's soundtrack can be customized with MP3s.",

        "description": "ExciteBots is a follow-up to the Wii launch title, Excite Truck. Like Excite Truck, it is in a sense a spiritual continuation of the Excite series started in the early days of the NES with Excite Bike. ExciteBots further mixes up the gameplay in the series, furthering the craziness and intensity brought on with Excite Truck. The latest change features the bikes or trucks from past games replaced by Bots--robotic cars with a few transformations and other elements.GameplayExciteBots plays almost exactly like it's Wii predecessor, meaning the game is played in an arcade-racing style featuring wild jumps, powerslides, turbo boosts, etc. Returning from Excite Truck is the set-up that earning stars through various means (during the races) is typically more important than simply finishing first. Players earn stars from stunts, long-distance jumps, driving through trees, crashing into other bots, and through a wide variety of other means. All of the means to earns stars in Excite Truck remain here, but ExciteBots has added several unusual, strange, and silly means to earn even more, including, but not limited to:• Hitting a football or soccer ball into a giant goal.• Launching a giant dart into a target.• Performing tricks on various stunt bars.• Attacking with items from item boxes (a la Super Mario Kart).• Gliding through butterfly icons.• Hitting Question Mark Triggers, which deform the environment.• Grinding on rails.As is typical of many Nintendo racing and sports games (such as Punch-Out!! or Uniracers), the game is set up in a series of cups of gradually increasing difficulty, each cup featuring four or five races. The game features five cups, each one unlocked gradually as players progress through races and earn enough stars. There are also different difficulty settings.ExciteBots also features a two-player mode (both online and offline), several mini-games, and a feature known as Poker Race, where the goal is to race through cards in order to build winning Poker hands.The BotsInitially, the game starts with six Bots, but as stars are earned through races, more Bots can be purchased and unlocked. Players may select the color of their Bot before each race, and new colors may also be purchased later on. The Bots are all designed around insects or small animals, such as grasshoppers or beetles, bats or turtles. Bots have the ability to glide during some segments of the game, and an arm extends from the back of each Bot to use items or activate stunt bars. Legs also extend from beneath the Bots, requiring the player to tilt the Wii Remote to make them \"run\" for brief periods of time.ControlLike Excite Truck and several Wii racing games, the game is controlled holding the Wii Remote sideways and tilting to steer. The tricks and stunts found in the game utilize a variety of motion controls and quick reflexes, especially where trick bars are concerned. For instance, the Elevator Bar (a vertical bar, like a fireman's pole) swings the player around it in a circle and requires the player to thrust the Wii Remote forward at the right time to launch forward at a high speed. The Red Bar (a horizontal beam near large open or hazardous areas) requires the player to move the Wii Remote forward and back in a circular motion, in increasing speeds to ramp up momentum and launch forward to continue the race.",

In the career mode \"Rule the Streets\", one creates a player and competes in tournaments around the world to obtain \"Skill Bills\" to buy clothing and upgrade his rating. As the player improves, he can captain his own street football team and eventually become an international. The best players have special moves often named after their nickname.

This is not only eye-candy but is also required to fill up your nitro and handicap your enemies.If you get bored of that, you can play one of the 12 mini-games.

You drive muscle cars around dirt tracks, battle them on destruction derby arenas, and take part in Ragdoll Olympics. That last one may need some explanation. When you crash in FlatOut, your driver (the Ragdoll) is flung through the windscreen, very much like in Rekkaturvat. This feature is used in the Ragdoll sports where the task is to propel the hapless driver as far, as high, or as accurately as possible. On the demolition arena the goal is to wreck other cars before yours is. Simple as that.The bulk of the game is racing though and it can be performed in typical quick race and time trial modes in addition to the proverbial career mode. There are also two different handling modes for the cars. Normal mode gives arcade type handling, suitable for gamepads. Professional mode seems to be designed for steering wheel owners and provides very challenging simulator-type handling. Not surprisingly since Bugbear's previous racing title Rally Trophy was considered to be very challenging, even demanding, simulation.Bugbear's experience with simulation dynamics shows in FlatOut. Almost everything on the track can be run into and it behaves as it should in real life. Or at least as in a car-chase movie. Stuff that cars scatter around are there on the next lap too and cars are gradually dismantled when hit to other cars or solid objects around the track.Multiplayer modes are of course great party hits.

The player controls a BMX biker, and is required to complete various goals within levels to unlock later courses. As the player performs tricks, they gain more points and fulfill requirements in the game. The control scheme is similar to that of the Dave Mirra games in that one button on the controller is used to perform tricks, and another is used to modify the trick once it's performed. Unlike other similar games, Gravity Games Bike rewards the same amount of points for performing the same trick repeatedly. The game has several different multiplayer modes",

Players can choose one of 20 characters that have unique running skills and techniques. Some of the characters and tracks can only be unlocked as the game progresses.  All of the runners will do just about anything to win, so the action can become down and dirty. Almost anything goes during the races including knocking opponents completely off the track with a well-placed kick, fist or weapon. Power-ups and booster items are scattered around the course for increasing performance, speed or providing a new method of attack. Strategy comes into play by knowing which character and which \"pod\" sidekick to choose.  There are three modes of play: Single Race, Cup and Championship. Each offers unique environments, different obstacles and challenges.  The Single Player game will put the player up against 5 CPU opponents. Multiplayer is offline and includes Deathmatch and Team modes (2 players on 2 teams) and up to 4 players in split screen.",

The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island.  Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.",

The user plays a character in the GG's, a gang of in-line skating graffiti artists who skate around Tokyo covering up rival gangs' graffiti, knocking over Rokkaku police, and dancing to the electric soundtrack. The game uses a cel-shaded style of animation, and has been widely acclaimed for its unique music style, detailed art, and gameplay. Though the game is set in the future, its style and content incorporates many aspects of 1980's old school hip hop culture, as well as 1990's J-pop culture.",

Each level starts with Johnny in a cannon. You shoot Johnny out of the cannon at the desired angle and use the select button to flap his arms and modify the arc and distance of your flight. Flapping your arms uses up power and you can gain more up power by running into lightening. When your power runs out, Johnny will plummet into a crash landing.Initially, when you \"Do Texas\" (the Crash Career mode), each level gives you a different target stunt, like hitting an oil well or a vulture, or landing in the bed of a pick-up truck when you crash. A red ball serves as a guide to show you where to find your target stunt in the level. Each level presents a new challenge that must be executed to move to the next level. There is also a target score for each level that gives you \"top reputation\" if you achieve it.In addition to Crash Career mode, there is also a High Score mode, where you determine your target stunts and your goal is to get the highest possible score. You can play this mode with up to four players. Each stunt only appears in this mode once it has been cleared in the Crash Career mode. All levels in all modes offer a replay.The game also offers the ability to join Digital Chocolate's mobile community, which allows you to report your scores to the server and view leader boards for the game.",

You play a young man, Johnny Crash, who loves performing crazy stunts. Each level starts with Johnny in a cannon. You shoot Johnny out of the cannon at the desired angle and use the select button to flap his arms and modify the arc and distance of your flight. Flapping your arms uses up power and you can gain more up power by running into lightening. When your power runs out, Johnny will plummet into a crash landing.Initially, when you \"Do Texas\" (the Crash Career mode), each level gives you a different target stunt, like hitting an oil well or a vulture, or landing in the bed of a pick-up truck when you crash. A red ball serves as a guide to show you where to find your target stunt in the level. Each level presents a new challenge that must be executed to move to the next level. There is also a target score for each level that gives you \"top reputation\" if you achieve it.In addition to Crash Career mode, there is also a High Score mode, where you determine your target stunts and your goal is to get the highest possible score. You can play this mode with up to four players. Each stunt only appears in this mode once it has been cleared in the Crash Career mode.

The game can also be ordered on a cartridge from the developer's website. In 2010 it was followed up with an iPhone/iPad release.The tracks remind of Excitebike while the gameplay seems inspired by Motocross Maniacs. The game offers two main modes: Free Ride (choose an unlocked bike and track to practise) and Challenge. The Challenge mode involves a series of events in 3 major categories: Beat the Clock (time-based), Trick Attack (points-based) and World Tour (race against 3 AI opponents). When all courses are finished, the final event, MXC Championship, is unlocked. The events are divided over different trees and completing certain courses unlocks new tracks or one of the 8 available bikes. The bikes have different statistics based on speed, handling, acceleration, height, boost and suspension.Gameplay involves a fair amount of physics. When the bike accelerates, the front wheel leaves the ground and this needs to be compensated by nudging the d-pad. Up and down on the d-pad is used to switch lanes. Many tricks (activated through the L-button) involve balance and constant correcting is needed. Next to accelerating, braking and tricks, there is a button for boost. Only a limited amount is offered, but it constantly regenerates at a slow rate. It is used to gain extra speed, especially before big jumps to gain extra air time. The full amount of boost should never be used or let maxed out, as too little or too much slows the bike down. While in the air, using a combination of the L-button and the d-pad, players can perform tricks such as superman, nac-nac of backflip. By completing Trick Attack events, new tricks can be unlocked.There are different types of tracks, set on a beach, an arena, downtown, in the snow, in a forest, in a desert and even a dump. They contain a series of jumps but also areas that slow down the bike, along with obstacles. The game screen shows the current position of the player (in World Tour), the current location on the track along with the finish, the time (remaining time in Beat the Clock), the current lap (in World Tour), the boost meter and the amount of points for a trick, and the remaining trick points needed (in Trick Attack).

The winner is the one to make it across the finish line still in one piece. Bikers fight hand-to-hand using a variety of weapons, while racing at high speeds on more than 20 unique circuits. Large and distinct environments create an ever-expanding race, aided by a third-generation physics engine that makes every move, fight and crash different and fresh.

You must reach the bottom within the time limit, remaining within the track boundaries and avoiding hazards including water, logs and stationary cars. The faster you complete the course, the more prize money you receive. Repairs to any damage to the bike (incurred by contact with the aforementioned hazards) must be paid for from this, but the rest can be spent on upgrades. The controls are rotational, with the fire button or space used for wheelies.###Screenshots<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/499557-motorbike-madness-dos-screenshot-floodlands-course.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/499557-motorbike-madness-dos-screenshot-floodlands-course.jpg\"/></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/150662-motorbike-madness-amstrad-cpc-screenshot-level-2.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/150662-motorbike-madness-amstrad-cpc-screenshot-level-2.jpg\"/></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/127830-motorbike-madness-commodore-64-screenshot-getting-ready-to.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/127830-motorbike-madness-commodore-64-screenshot-getting-ready-to.jpg\"/></a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/118759-motorbike-madness-atari-st-screenshot-title-screen.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/s/118759-motorbike-madness-atari-st-screenshot-title-screen.jpg\"/></a>"

It is the fourth game in the MotorStorm series and the third for the PlayStation 3. It was announced shortly before the beginning of the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010 on the PlayStation Blog by Evolution Studios on 10 June 2010.[4]  MotorStorm: Apocalypse was released in Europe on 16 March 2011[1] but the UK release on 18 March was delayed by Sony Computer Entertainment UK following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.[5] The Australian launch went ahead as planned on 17 March, but Sony announced further shipments of the game to that country would be halted in the wake of the disaster. The planned North American release date of 12 April 2011[3] was delayed by Sony[6] who later confirmed new releases dates of 31 March 2011 in the UK[2] and 3 May 2011 in North America.[7]",

Players try to become the world's best urban footballer by conquering other teams using several gravity-defying tricks like up-the-wall passes, off-the-wall catches, and highlight-reel wall jukes.Like the other games in the Street franchise, the game is played with a small amount of players and a focus on arcade gameplay. Unlike the first game, the walls can now be used for run-up passes and receptions, or bonuses by aiming for posters and hotspots.There are twelve arenas to compete in (2 unlockable) and the players are licensed from the 2004 NFL rosters. Multiplayer is available on the PS2, PSP and Xbox versions. In singleplayer, there are various game modes such as NFL Challenge where the player has 150 days to build a team to take on a squad of legends.

Each location (city streets, mall, and an industrial compound) is composed of three separate sections.  In the first round, players qualify for the race by completing three laps within the allotted time. Next, players race by challenging two other opponents in a three-lap challenge. Completing these two objectives will open up the area's skatepark, and by beating the park's overall score, a new member will be added to the racing team.",

Players control any of the four characters to snowboard, skateboard, bike, and inline skate through 16 levels of single-player story mode, free play, or Titos Challenge. Performing tricks and completing tasks as Team Rocket tries to help Raymondo will progress players through the game.  In Story Mode, the chosen character must complete tasks such as finding bike parts, collecting flags, and navigating through gates in a downhill snowbaord challenge. Performing tricks to earn high scores is another included task. Each level is timed and the tasks must be completed before the time runs out in order to win and progress to the next level. Mad Town and the ski slopes are some of the areas the team will visit in Story Mode with the main objective being to advertise the 2001 line of Rocket Boards.",

The former is made up of a plethora of obstacles such as pipes, ice and lava pits, thorn patches, and other such impediments, many of which must be cleared using your animal's innate jumping ability.  The power-ups provided allow characters to fly; turn into ghosts in order to avoid obstructions; transform the course into mud or ice or even increase in size in order to squash any competitors in their path.

A major difference in game play compared to predecessors in the series is the ability to extend wings from the cars in midair and glide. As with previous titles in the franchise, Rush 2049 features a stunt mode in which the player scores points for complex mid-air maneuvers and successful landings. There is also a multiplayer deathmatch battle mode. There are six race tracks, four stunt arenas, eight battle arenas, and one unlockable obstacle course named The Gauntlet. The single player race mode places emphasis on outlandish and death-defying shortcuts in each track. The game has a soundtrack mostly comprising techno music.",

All of your favorite SESAME STREET characters are the competitors in these original contests, and winning (for once) is not the most important thing. Take the adorable athletes through six big time sporting events: Guide Grover through a unicycle race, lead Elmo into a roller skating contest, and push Ernie past the rapids in his own bathtub. Big Bird is along to conduct all of the post-game interviews, putting the emphasis of the events squarely on fun and fair play rather than heated competition. The game's controls are easy top learn allowing little gamers to get the hang of things quickly and an in-game tutorial teaches the ins and outs of each wacky sport. The excellent graphics and familiar faces make the game look and feel just like an episode of the classic kids' show. Hand-held sports have never been so fun!",

        "description": "Skate of the Art is a skateboarding game that is based on the Commodore 64 game Rollerboard. The two game have almost identical gameplay but have different level designs. The Amiga game also features completely remade graphics. The game is side scrolling and the player's task in each level is to get to the finishing line without crashing on the obstacles that lies in his path.

Three of these twisted trials are cut from the concrete courses of pro competitions. Each pits you head to head with a friend, shooting ramps or racing downhill, while going for rock n' rolls, hand plants, aerials, rail slides and methods! Then blast into \"Mad Max on Wheels\", dueling to the death with Bionic Lester, the dirtiest dude in the jam and joust. And finally \"Skate and Destroy\", a challenge that'll turn you into a Samurai skater, karate chopping your way through a tough alley filled with thugs, trash and unmentionable traffic hazards. So squirt a little oil onto your ball bearings, and prepare to Skate or Die!",

The game features snowmobiles (referred to as sleds), stunts and fourteen snow-covered courses consisting of slippery slopes, inclement weather and treacherous cliffs. Six racers were selectable from the outset and two more were unlockable, each of which had different snowmobile handling attributes.",

        "description": "he game is set in Snow Town, which is the main hometown of the protagonists. The plot follows the daily lives and adventures of the kids, and the rather ridiculous attempts of Damien to sabotage them.  The gameplay of this game is almost identical to its predecessor's, but with a few differences.  There are now three distinct playing modes: the Story mode, which follows the game plot and uses the classical system of cash prizes by winning the races; the battle mode, which includes multiplayer mode; and the Training mode.  There were new additions and changes to the Items and Shots. All of them were redesigned and the Shots were renamed as Weapons. Additions include the Rocket, the Wings and the Whirlwind (see more below). Other changes to the Items and Weapons include the reduction in the freeze time when a character is hit by the Freezing Shot, and the effect of losing coins when hit by a Slapstick.  The special tricks (which were different for each character and required the player to perform a combo to do them) were replaced by the ability of doing multiple tricks while in the air. It also added the ability to repel Weapon attacks by performing a Trick or Board Grab in the imminence of the hit. The player can also look behind by pressing the R button.",

        "description": "he kids are arguing about their snowboarding skills. The debate escalates to the point where they decide to hold a snowboarding tournament to determine who is the best. One character, Shinobin, has no involvement whatsoever until he is unlocked by the player.  In addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds \"Shots\" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both.  The game has nine main courses. Although some of the courses are snowy mountains, many are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival.  There were several game mechanics that were unique to Snowboard Kids from other snowboard games and racing games at the time. One was the addition of the second item slot, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Also, players needed to pay 100 gold in order to grab an item during the race, which could be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also required players to race down the hill for multiple laps. Once a player had reached the bottom of the hill, he or she would need to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and could not be attacked by other players in this transition.",

For speed fans, the Race Mode allows players to race against the clock or two computer-controlled opponents. For those more interested in catching big air, Snowboarding's Trick Mode requires gamers to perform numerous maneuvers to gain more time to complete courses. In both modes, gamers can choose from one of three different boarder characters as they ride through the game's 27 different courses. Additionally, each of these courses can be tackled by two players at once in a horizontally divided split-screen.",

Players will discover a colossal mountain where they can immerse themselves in a free-roaming snow paradise. The ultimate all-mountain experience, SSX 3 features all-new events and courses, awe-inspiring tricks and a cast of cool, customisable characters. Discover the open terrain, explore its hidden crevices, and conquer its peaks.  Produced under the EA SPORTS BIG brand, the SSX 3 development team at EA Canada is adding technologies that bring to life rich natural graphics such as snow that sparkles and blows in the wind and realistic character shadowing. A new gameplay experience allows users to seamlessly ride from one awesome area to the next- entering competitions, taking on Big Challenges and discovering hidden collectibles. SSX 3 has blown out the trick component with unlimited combos and new, over-the-top tricks.  In addition to the new boarding venues, Big Challenges rewards players for completing any of the more than 100 unique challenges as they explore the mountain's vast world. Grind billboards, board press logs, even hand plant the fence line.  The musical soundtrack features a broad range of music from artists including the X-Ecutioners, Felix Da Housecat, Queens of the Stone Age, N.E.R.D., and many more.",

        "description": "ony Hawk's American Sk8land is the handheld version of American Wasteland, the seventh entry in the Tony Hawk's series. It is the first entry in the series for the Nintendo DS, and the fifth to appear on Game Boy Advance.  American Sk8land uses cel shaded visuals and it was developed by Vicarious Visions, the developer of the Game Boy Advance Tony Hawk games. The game is based on its console counterpart, American Wasteland, featuring the same soundtrack, many of the same environments, characters.  The top screen is used to display the main gameplay, while the touch screen displays an overhead map of the area the player is currently skating, as well as icons for easily performing tricks. The touch screen is also used to create Skateboard art. Furthering the use of the DS's functions is the ability to record, with the DS microphone, your own sound clips for use in the game.  American Sk8land was the first Nintendo DS game released by a third party to support the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, the online service for the Nintendo DS. Players are able to play Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo and The Price is Wrong. Players are also able to upload or download graffiti, board art, highscores, and replays to one of the servers, and can periodically download new goals to complete.  In the DS version, the ability to get off the skateboard and walk around was removed; however, this was somewhat balanced by the ability to come to a complete stop and rotate the camera.  The name is shared by the Game Boy Advance version, also created by Vicarious Visions. The GBA version does not share the same graphics, however, having an isometric point of view, polygonal skaters and pre-rendered levels creating a 3D sensation.",

The main drive of the game is that your hanging around with a skating group and its leader, who also happens to be a skating legend, at their skate park in Beverly Hills called Skate Ranch. Throughout the game you must help your friends by getting skate pieces for Skate Ranch.  The game marks the third reinvention of the series, with Pro Skater being the first, and Underground being the second. It comes with brand new features like the ability to change your personal appearance in game, as well as the ability to get off of the skateboard and use a BMX. For the first time all of levels are strung together into one big environment, which gets rid of loading times and menu selection.  Old features were also kept like Create-a-park, which dates back to the Pro Skater series. Missions are still acquired by going up to random people or friends and accepting the mission they want you to run.  The game also includes a multiplayer mode and co-op for up to 2 players for added replay value.",

By holding the controller sideways, tilting the controller side to side, you can turn and do aerial flips.

        "description": "op Skater is an arcade game released by Sega in 1997, and built on the Sega Model 2 hardware. It was one of the first arcade games to feature a skateboard controller interface.In Top Skater, players stand on a skateboard-like platform which swung side-to-side or tilted, manipulating the actions of the avatars in the game. Similar games were made for skiing, snowboarding and other sports of this nature. The game consisted of various ramps, rails and other skating objects from which the player could do tricks to gain points.The main sponsor of the game was Coca-Cola.The soundtrack of the game consisted entirely of these songs by the punk rock band Pennywise.The game's style is like that of the later and more known Sega game Crazy Taxi, noticeably the character art design and music type. Top Skater was also directed by Kenji Kanno. A lesser known sequel called Air Trix was made in 2001.",

It was used in the 2006 edition of the Electronic Sports World Cup (2006), held from 27th June to 2nd July 2006 in Paris - Bercy, for a grand total of $40,000. The game is based on TrackMania Sunrise and introduces a new vehicle, and the stadium as a new environment, where all races are held.TrackMania is a modern version of Stunts, using basic controls and offering racing courses with tricky sections including loops, corkscrews, turbo blocks and huge jumps that require technical skill. In the single player mode, you can practice on 90 tracks, divided over three skills levels. Each race is associated with three time standards to be met to win a bronze, silver or gold medal. There is also a hot-seat multiplayer option where up to eight players can race against the time or with only one try.In the online mode, you have to register an online account and select your nation. Each car has a custom theme per country, but you can also create a unique look in the paint shop. There are three modes in online multiplayer games, with support for up to 20 players. In Round, you race against all other players with only one try, and you receive points based on the final standings. The same course is played until someone has 30 points. If you crash early, you can track other players in the spectator mode. Other vehicles are visible on the screen, but cannot be hit and they cannot slow you down. Time Attack is similar, but with an unlimited amount of tries. In Team, players race in teams and the points are calculated as the sum of the individual rankings. During online play, there are detailed rankings based on your efforts. There is a ladder with an overview of all players, but also a global ranking with all the nations.The game comes with an in-game server browser, colored nicknames, a chat function, buddy lists, extensive admin options for server owners, and commands for launching gameplay votes. New tracks can be created in the included graphical editor, and shared with other players. The track editor also features a media tracker, to add text, intros, special effects, and sound and camera movement to your creations. You can design new challenges and exchange replays of your best times. Replays can be exported to avi if you want to share your time with someone who does not have the game. If you own TrackMania Original or TrackMania Sunrise (eXtreme), you can attach your serial number to your online account. This enables P2P, allowing other registered players to view your custom-painted car, and vice versa.",

If you have friends that are into snowboarding, you can challenge them to a race via the link cable. No matter what mode you play, you must keep an eye out for obstacles, or you will lose precious speed and time. Luckily, you can pick up icons that will give you turbo boosts, and you can perform tricks or go through slalom gates that will award additional speed boosts as well.

A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sport's name).  Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.  Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks. Co-operative mode has one player driving the boat while the other hangs on behind, with new challenges for the boat driver to complete as well as the rider.",

Custom characters and player Mii's add even more dimension to snow-capped adventures across even more mountain terrain than ever with vast free-riding areas. Leisurely gondola rides to sloping peaks invite a breathtaking panoramic experience, while heli-drops from extreme dizzying heights offer-up opportunities to shred down vertical cliffs and severe precipices. Players should be sure to watch out for avalanches!    Hot Doggers can quench their thirst for excitement with half-pipe courses, and ski technique challenges, while loungers can look forward to other activities including ski school, board school, moguls and slaloms, as well as animal search and rescue. Players can enjoy the sprawling vistas with day, night and dusk skiing, offering countless nuances to an ever-expanding list of experiences. The whole family can still enjoy fast-paced racing action or free-skiing with four-player fun, while single players can enjoy the ride with up to three AI-controlled skiing buddies.",

XGRA features a wide range of riders, tracks and bikes that can accelerate at an incredibly rapid rate, going from 0 to 300 mph in a matter of seconds. A returning feature is the ability to break sound barrier: upon reaching 750MPH, all sound effects will cut out, except for item collection sound, other tider's taunts, weapons firing, and in-game music.  XGRA allows players to race for 8 different teams, with each team's bike having their own advantages and drawbacks such as Regeneration, Handling, Speed, Acceleration and Shielding.",

At the start of the game, players choose between characters Guppi and Fin and set off on a trip sponsored by the Xtreme Cola Company, which has invited all extreme sports athletes to Xtreme Sports Island to compete in a tournament. Among the people players encounter are the members of the Bone-Heads gang, who are the antagonists. The player's objective is to unravel the mystery behind them and win the tournament at the same time.  There are two modes available: Practice and Xtreme Island Adventure. In the former, players can participate in 15 different challenges with 3 difficulty settings. In the latter, players move around the island participating in events and exploring the surroundings. Some of the people players meet will give the player clues to solving the mystery of the Bone-Heads while others will issue challenges to compete in various sports. Players collect medals as the player win events. Players must win a certain number of easier challenges before the referees will allow the player into the tougher ones. Along the way players can also find Twitchy Shakes, which are special drinks that will increase the player's abilities depending on the next event the player enters. Players may be able to attain higher speeds or even become invincible.",
