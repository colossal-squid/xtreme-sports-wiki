Smashing Drive puts you in the driver's seat of an insane, outrageous taxi on the busy streets of New York City. Your job is to simply race from point to point in the fastest time possible. 
 
The key to success in Smashing Drive lies in two features: crazy power-ups and hidden shortcuts. Almost all of the power-ups transform your taxi in some way that allows you to smash your way through traffic with ease. And the shortcuts usually involve crashing through the insides of buildings, like movie theaters and sports arenas.
