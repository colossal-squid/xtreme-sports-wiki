Mad Dash Racing combines high-speed combat and 3D adventure action with a crew of motley characters for an insane multiplayer competition for up to four. Players select from nine different characters, each with their own unique personality and abilities, and compete in a race for survival against the evil Hex, his dirty minions and your unforgiving friends. Glide across rivers of hot, steaming lava, slip through underwater pipes, bash through mammoth boulders, and slide down icy glaciers to beat the other racers and escape Hex's wicked wrath.
