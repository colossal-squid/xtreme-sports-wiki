  "description": "\nAs the title implies, Polaris SnoCross is a game based on the sport of snowmobile racing. It has 3 available modes (Single Event, Instant Action, and Tournament) and supports up to 4 players.\nIn Single Event, the player can select any of the 5 sleds available for racing. The player can also select the rider suit and the race’s difficulty. Tricks and stunts can also be performed while in-game. The current mode supports up to 4 human players.\n\n\nInstant Action instantly lets you in on the game by randomly selecting the sled, track, time of day and weather conditions.\n\n\nIn Tournament, the player can select to play in a new one or continue from a previously saved game. There are 7 events in the Tournament mode and each one consists of a 3 day race (3 races basically). Only one is available at first but each time the player successfully complete an event another of higher difficulty is unlocked.\n",
