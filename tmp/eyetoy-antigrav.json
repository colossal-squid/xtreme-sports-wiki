  "description": "\nEyeToy: AntiGrav is the first full-fledged game for the PS2 Eyetoy camera peripheral. Using a head-and-hands body recognition system, the onscreen character responds to the control of the player's body movements. Take one of 8 hoverboarders through 5 tracks ranging from a run-down Chinese wharf to an intense professional hoverboarding arena. And while it is an \"extreme\" sports boarding game, the gameplay contains flavors of SSX, DDR, Stun Runner, a little Return of the Jedi, and a lot of other influences. Of course, it is the uniqueness of the controls that drives the design of the game, the experience of the game, and ultimately whether or not the player enjoys it.\n\n\n",
