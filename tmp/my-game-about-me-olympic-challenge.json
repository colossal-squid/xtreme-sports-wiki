  "description": "\nMy Game About Me: Olympic Challenge is based on the semi-autobiographical webcomic by Nathan Stapley, My Comic About Me. It is a parody of sports games, where there are a number of \"Olympic\" events to compete in to win medals. However, the events are not Olympic-caliber at all. The event mini-games included are eating, sleeping, and surfing while avoiding obstacles. Along with Nathan, there are multiple characters to choose from, as well as characters that can be unlocked.\n",
