  "description": "\nMotor Mania is a shareware motorcycle game in which the object is to race through a series of jumps in a limited amount of time. Not only is time a critical factor, the player must manage their engine to avoid overheating, for example by not using the turbo charger when in the air so that it has time to cool.\n\nThe game is both keyboard and joystick controlled and has options to play with a colour or monochrome monitor. There is a high score screen, the keyboard action keys can be redefined but there is no sound. In the registered version is a track designer function\n",
