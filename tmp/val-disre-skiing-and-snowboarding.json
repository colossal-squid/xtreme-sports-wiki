  "description": "\nThis is a skiing and snowboarding game that takes place entirely at the French Val d'Isère resort. Both sports are represented equally. There are three events: downhill, slalom, and giant slalom. There are also three game modes, free ride, training, and competition. Competition mode provides a series of timed events in which to compete leading up to a final timed event. The other two modes are self-explanatory.\n\nGame play is presented with scaled 2D sprites that present a 3D effect, similar to many early racing games. Everything wooshes by at extremely high speed, and winning requires the player to have great reflexes.\n",
