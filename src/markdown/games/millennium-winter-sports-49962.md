###Description:
MILLENNIUM WINTER SPORTS allows you to experience the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat in eight winter sports. Try to get through the course as fast a possible in the bobsled; out-skate your opponent to the finish line in speed skating; see who can jump the farthest in two separate ski-jumping events; see if you can pull off twists and flips while flying through the air in the aerials competition; strap on the skis and navigate the downhill course; or strap on a snowboard to navigate the giant slalom course. For the ultimate in snowboarding action, try to impress the judges with your performance on the halfpipe. Practice any of the events in the Challenge mode or try to become the best winter athlete in the world with the Championship mode. All of the action of winter sports can be yours with MILLENNIUM WINTER SPORTS.
