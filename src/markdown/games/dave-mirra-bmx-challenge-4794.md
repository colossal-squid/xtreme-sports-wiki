###Description:
Dave Mirra is to BMX what Edison was to electricity. What the Wright Brothers were to flight. Like them, he rewrote the rules of what's possible. On the ground or above it, the Miracle Boy has redefined the boundaries of the sport and then promptly surpassed them. Now, the legend of the winningnest X Games competitor of all time is on the PSP system, letting you defy gravity wherever you go. With ad hoc wireless play for 1-4 players, you can challenge your friends to racing and freestyle competition and see who's got what it takes to ride with the greatest. 17 levels across 9 different environments. Customizable player characters, with tricked out clothes and gear. 10 Bikes to choose from and customize as you win.
