Enter the arctic world that is TransWorld Snowboarding and experience life on the soft powder!

TransWorld Snowboarding offers huge, vibrant, real-world snowboarding levels with natural snow kickers and ramps for launching; rails and downed trees to jib and grind on; and natural half-pipes and quarter-pipes for performing tons of tricks. But it’s not all fun and games — treacherous terrain and steep cliffs lurk around every corner! TransWorld Snowboarding offers 1-4 player simultaneous play and licensed music chosen specifically to fit the laid-back, stare-death-in-the-face snowboarding lifestyle.
