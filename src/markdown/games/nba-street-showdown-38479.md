###Description:
Rule the streets in this big-time baller game, based on the console arcade-style NBA game. Take on the biggest stars of the NBA in full Street style, battle it out with a 3-on-3 game, or go on the ultimate quest to become a Street legend in the King of the Court mode. Create your own Baller and add your personal style. Two unique PSP modes feature unique gameplay for the portable -- earn style points in Shot Blocker and Arcade Shootout modes and enhance your status as the game’s newest street legend. Wireless head-to-head play allows you to go one-on-one against a friend in the original Pick Up game mode, while Party Play lets up to four players can compete in two high-flyin’ game modes, Shot Blocker and Arcade Shootout, using one PSP.
