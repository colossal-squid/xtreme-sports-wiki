Downhill Domination is a video game based on a fictional racing event with fictional racers mixed with a few unlockable professional racers. The game was released exclusively for the PlayStation 2. 
 
Downhill Domination includes a very different style of gameplay that differs from standard bike racing games by having the character riding downhill almost exclusively (hence the name), due to the incline of the tracks.
