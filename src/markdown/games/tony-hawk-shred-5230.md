###Description:
Tony Hawk: Shred is the 2010 sequel to the video game Tony Hawk: Ride, a spin-off of the Tony Hawk series.[1] The game is a peripheral-based, motion controlled skateboarding game. 
 
Shred introduces a snowboarding mode to the series as well as Avatar and Mii support on the Xbox 360 and Wii versions respectively. A "surfing" mode was worked on for the game, but was soon scrapped due to funds and short amount of time to work on it.
