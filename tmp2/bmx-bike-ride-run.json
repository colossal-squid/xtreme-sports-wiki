  "description": "\nBMX Bike Ride & Run is a free-to-play BMX game. The goal is to avoid obstacles on your way to get the longest distance. The game includes several types of BMX bikes with different characteristics. They are unlocked in a shop spending a virtual currency earned by catching gold coins and doing stunts. The gameplay is based on a two-finger mechanism: touching the right side of the screen is used to jump and the left side is used to switch between the three paths on the track. Stunts are performed by shaking the device and the bike goes forward automatically.\n",
