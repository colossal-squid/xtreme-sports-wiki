  "description": "\nNitrobike is a take on the classic game of Excitebike, where the player takes the helm of a motorbike equipped with a nitro rocket, racing in 20 different tracks and over 60+ different events. The player must avoid stationary obstacles and slower riders.\n\nThere is career mode where the player can unlock new characters and bikes by winning these events and a six-player online capability. The controls mostly consist of using the Wii remote to steer and accelerate as well as boosting with the nitro rocket. There is also a four-player bowling game where players can hurl their rider at a set of huge bowling pins.\n",
