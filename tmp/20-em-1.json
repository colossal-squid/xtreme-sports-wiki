  "description": "\n20 em 1 (20 in 1) is a compilation of twenty previously unreleased games in a single cartridge, which came bundled with Tec Toy's Master System III Compact (Master System II in Europe and US). The games included are:\nThe player is a construction worker trying to get falling tools with a bucket. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out.\nThe player is what looks like an alien machine, side scrolling over a planet collecting food and avoiding obstacles such as bombs. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out.\nA skateboarding side scrolling game: the player must run as far as you he while avoiding obstacles such as holes in the street, until the time runs out.\nThe player is what seems to be a flea, running and jumping while the screen scrolls over a mountain of blocks, avoiding to get stuck behind the hills.\nThe player is a mouse trying to catch the cheese pieces that fall from the shelves. In order to do so, he can jump (by pressing button 1), and he must get as many as he can until the time runs out.\nThe player is a diver on a sunken ship, getting coins which fall from above, while avoiding being caught by a shark. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out.\nA motocross racing game: the player must run down the road while avoiding obstacles trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out.\nAn arcade racing game: the player must run down the street while avoiding getting hit by the other cars, until the time runs out.\nThe player is a little Brazilian Indian sailing his boat on a river, while avoiding obstacles such as rocks and arrows. He must get as far as he can until the time runs out.\nA helicopter combat game. The player must shoot (by pressing button 1) the enemy helicopter as much as he can, avoiding to get hit, until the time runs out.\nThe player is a frog trying to catch the insects that fall from the sky. He must get as many as he can until the time runs out, while jumping from one victoria amazonica to another. He must project his tong (by pressing the button 1) in order to get the insects.\nA classic space shooter. Fly your spaceship while the screen scrolls down, avoiding obstacles and shooting as many spaceships as he can, until the time runs out.\nA side scrolling flight shooter. The player must shoot (by pressing button 1) as many balloons as he can while avoiding getting hit by other planes, until the time runs out.\nA roller skating side scrolling game: the player must run as far as you he while avoiding obstacles such as logs in the street, until the time runs out.\nA pong game with a twist: the player is a cooker trying to hit mini-pizzas inside an oven. The pizzas will bounce back if they don't get inside the oven. The player has 5 mini-pizzas and must try to hit as many as he can until the time runs out.\nThe player is a insecticide can trying to kill the insects that fall from the roof. He must kill as many as he can until the time runs out by shooting insecticide (by pressing the button 1) at them.\nIn this side scrolling game, the player is a boy who must run all the way right while shooting (by pressing button 1) other boys with his water gun, avoiding to get hit by them, before the time runs out. He must shoot as many boys as he can.\nA skiing game: the player must race down the mountain while avoiding obstacles trying to reach the next checkpoint before the time runs out.\nThe player controls a police car running up the screen, while avoiding getting hit by other cars. He must get as far as he can, until the time runs out.\nAnother pong game: this time the player is at a squash court. He must try to hit the ball as much as he can until the time runs out. He has 3 balls.\nIn order to win, the player must score a certain amount of points in each game (which vary from game to game). If the player scores less the specified amount, he loses. In the \"catch the object\" and shooter games (1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17), points are earned by catching or shooting objects. In racing games (3, 7, 8, 9, 14, 18 and 19), points are earned by the distance ran. In game 15 points are earned by hitting the oven; in game 20, by number of hits in the ball. In these games (15 and 20), the player can loose if he misses all his balls/pizzas. In game 4 no points are earned at all, and you'll loose if the character gets stuck and the screen scrolls over him.\n\nThe game has only two songs, one played at the title screen, the other played during all gameplay. All the text in the game is in Portuguese.\n",
