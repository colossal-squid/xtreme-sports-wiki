  "description": "\nStreet Sk8er was one of the first skateboarding games to hit the PlayStation. It is much simpler than its genre brother Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, with a simpler way of performing tricks and more linear stage design. What it does bring to the table though is a tailor made licensed soundtrack with artists such as H2O, Less Than Jake and I Against I, and some hidden characters and stages to unlock as the player progresses through the game. There are different characters to choose from, boards and stages.\n",
