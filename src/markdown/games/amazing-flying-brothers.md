###Description: 
Flex your muscles as a trapeze artist in The Amazing Flying Brothers. Bound by the laws of gravity, a little guy needs to perform stunts to wow the audience, by flying from swing to swing. There are only two, so the player has no choice to go back and forth, or go for a surprise by landing on the same swing, until the final verdict - sandy circus ground - is met.

The game is entirely controlled by a single mouse button. Hold it down while the character is coming down to accelerate, or hold it while he is going up to slow down; click to release the bar. Points are awarded for performing flips, flight time, kissing the ceiling, quick changes, and most importantly; dramatic drumming. After a while, a pile of little guys covers the ground, not softening the fall in any way.
