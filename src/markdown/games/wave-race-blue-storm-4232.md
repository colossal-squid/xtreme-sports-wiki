Racing atop a bed of dynamically changing waves, gamers must navigate their way through eight different environments under random weather conditions, including the powerful and visually impressive Storm setting, in the sequel to the N64 hit Wave Race. Features tutorial stunt, and time trial challenges, but the biggest single-player attraction is the Championship mode, which offers shortcut-laden Normal, Hard, and Expert circuits, and sends you and seven other racers around eight different course environments loaded with buoys. The difficulty ramps up quickly due to buoy placement and is particularly demanding in the last races of Expert mode where the CPU opponents get downright malicious.
