###Description: 
The famous Circus Morelli offers five exciting events: trampolining, tightrope-walking, juggling, knife-throwing and jumping clowns.

You control the artists during their sometimes dangerous stunts.

Each attraction can be practiced on its own before all five have to be performed in order in the main performance of the evening.

Each attraction also has a special two-player team mode.
