  "description": "\nIce Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games is an action game loosely based on the 2012 animated movie Ice Age: Continental Drift. The story begins when the mammoth Manny and the herd discover a secret treasure (a bowl of fruit). The pirates are also after the treasure, so they collectively decide to hold the Arctic games to determine who gets the prize. The players participate in a series of short comic events including ski jumping, ice smashing, glacial hopping etc. The players may choose any side - Manny and the herd or the seafaring pirates (the crew). There's also a two-player competition mode.\n",
