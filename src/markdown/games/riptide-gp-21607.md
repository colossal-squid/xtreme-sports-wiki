###Description:
Rev up your supercharged hydro jet and take a wild ride through twisting canals and rivers, futuristic cityscapes, and mysterious research facilities. Skill, stunts, and speed will be your best allies as you grab massive air off huge waves, kick out death-defying tricks, and boost your hydro jet to victory across a dynamic, ever-changing torrent of foam and spray.

Designed from the ground up to take full advantage the latest mobile hardware, Riptide GP features super-realistic water physics, real-time reflections, and gorgeous high-detail vehicles and environments.
