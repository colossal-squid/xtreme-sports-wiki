###Description:
MTV Sports: Snowboarding is an extreme sports game where you have to perform tricks on your snowboard. You can opt to play with one of six different boarders, with each their own abilities. The game features five game modes: qualifying, challenge, create-a-park, head-to-head and training. The qualifying mode offers three levels where you have to score enough points to unlock the challenge mode, where you can challenge other boarders in trick events or races. The create-a-park mode allows you to create your own track to play on. head-to-head allows you to play a multiplayer match against a friend. The available tracks come in four general types: mountain X, big air contest, half-pipe and slopestyle.
