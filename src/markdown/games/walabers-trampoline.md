###Description: 
Walaber's Trampoline is a gymnastics simulation where the player can perform realistic trampoline jumps based on twists, flips, tucks and pikes. Different game modes are offered: free play, story, competition and online multiplayer. The story mode introduces the different jumps with helpful demonstrations. By performing well, the player's character, customizable in appearance, earns points distributed over jump, flip and twist power. Progressing through the different story modes opens up new locales, from the backyard to a real gym club, and four different competitions.

The game offers different camera modes, simulation strictness and the music is provide by indie rock bands. Points are gained by doing difficult jumps involving many twists and turns, preferably in succession.
