  "description": "\nXtreme Sports is a multi-trial sports game that combines different sports in one race. Snowboard, ATV, Delta-plane and Mountain Bike are available from the beginning; Base Jump and Bungee Jumping need to be unlocked.\n\nFour game modes are available: Championship, Race, Time Trial, and Practice. There are three tracks available right away, and six more to unlock. In all the modes, the gameplay is somewhat arcade-oriented, requiring the player to react quickly. A special boost gauge can be filled by doing specific actions, increasing the player's chances of victory.\n",
