###Description:
4x4 Evolution is a racing game featuring real-life pickup trucks and SUV's. Actual trucks from manufacturers such as Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, Nissan, Toyota and more are included. 
 
The actual racing game is based very heavily on Terminal Reality's Monster Truck Madness series of games, except with SUV's instead of monster trucks. 
 
One significant feature of 4x4 Evo is the online multi-player option. The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions can compete against each other in 4 player online races.
