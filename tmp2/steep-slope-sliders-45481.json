  "description": "\nSteep Slope Sliders is a snowboarding game offering a free rotation system for a large variety of tricks. The game sees you picking one of a motley crew of boarders and taking to the slopes as you try to get the best times and/or scores on each slope. Courses from Canada to Italy to Japan are available, as well as the option to play on a half-pipe purely for points and an Alpine track for time attacks. In addition, the game boasts a number of unlockable characters and locations. It also features a replay system with editable camera/graphics effects, and thanks to the Saturn's clock you'll find yourself boarding at the various locales at an appropriate time of day relative to the system clock setting.\n",
