  "description": "\nWinter Race 3D is a sports game which simulates skiing, snowboard and snowmobile races in a 1st person perspective. The game is arcade oriented, which means that the controls are limited to left, right, more speed or less speed. Only in the snowboard races the player can do stunts while jumping to gain bonus time which gets offset against his end time.\n\nThe game features five courses which are varied from a linear downhill course to a giant slalom or roofed courses. There is no tournament or multiplayer mode so the only motivation for playing is the beating of the own record times.\n",
